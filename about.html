<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Nick Schreiter. I'm an aspiring web developer. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
  I got interested in coding when I was a recruiter at Sandhills Global, since I primarily interviewed candidates for software and database positions. </p>

  <p>In my spare time, I enjoy exercising, focusing both on weight lifting and cardio, playing video games on my Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X, reading all kinds of novels, and watching movies/tv shows.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy the projects I've been working on. As a novice, I hope to continue to put my projects on here for you to see. I am always open to feedback as well, to make my projects better.</p>
